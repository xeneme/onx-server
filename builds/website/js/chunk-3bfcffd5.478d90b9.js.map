Risk Disclosure</h3>\r\n      <p></p>\r\n      <p>\r\n        5.1. Trading risks. You acknowledge and agree that you shall access and\r\n        use the Services at your own risk. The risk of loss in trading Digital\r\n        Asset pairs and Digital Asset and Legal Tender pairs can be substantial.\r\n        You should, therefore, carefully consider whether such trading is\r\n        suitable for you in light of your circumstances and financial resources.\r\n        You should be aware of the following points:\r\n      </p>\r\n      <p>\r\n        5.2. You may sustain a total loss of the Funds in your\r\n        {{ Host }} Account, and, in some cases, you may incur losses beyond such\r\n        Funds. If the market moves against your position, you may be called upon\r\n        by us to provide a substantial amount of additional margin Funds, on\r\n        short notice, in order to maintain your position. If you do not provide\r\n        the required Funds within the time required by us, your position may be\r\n        liquidated at a loss, and you will be liable for any resulting deficit\r\n        in your {{ Host }} Account.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <p>\r\n        5.3. Under certain market conditions, you may find it difficult or\r\n        impossible to liquidate a position. This can occur, for example, when\r\n        the market reaches a daily price fluctuation limit (\"limit move\"), if\r\n        there is insufficient liquidity in the market.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <p>\r\n        5.4. Placing contingent orders, such as \"stop-loss\" or \"stop-limit\"\r\n        orders, will not necessarily limit your losses to the intended amounts,\r\n        since market conditions may make it impossible to execute such orders.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <p>\r\n        5.5. All Digital Asset positions involve risk, and a \"spread\" position\r\n        may not be less risky than an outright \"long\" or \"short\" position. The\r\n        use of leverage can work against you as well as for you and can lead to\r\n        large losses as well as gains.
